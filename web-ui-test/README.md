# web-ui frontend tech challenge

UX has passed some mockups of a page for you to build. Only problem is, the page needs to be built in about 3 hours, and you are the only one left in the building!

Build an interactable page styled as closely as possible to the mockups. You may need to make some tradeoffs for things that won't be finished in the timeframe given.

- solution should be made with React.js, and any other libraries of your choice
- data should be retrieved through an api request to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tapify/public-code-test/master/web-ui-test/tickets.json
- try and get as close as you can and do what you can in that time-frame!
